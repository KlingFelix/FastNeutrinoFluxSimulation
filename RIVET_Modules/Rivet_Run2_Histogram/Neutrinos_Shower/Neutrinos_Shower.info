Description:
  'This module obtains a first rough estimate of the energy spectrum of 
   the neutrinos from downstream hadronic showers going through the 
   far-forward LHC neutrino detectors FASERv and SND@LHC. Note that this is 
   just a first estimate of this subdominant production mode, which 
   should therefore not be considered as accurate.'
