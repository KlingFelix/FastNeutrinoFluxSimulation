## Introduction

With the upcoming Run~3 of the LHC, the FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC detectors will start a new era of neutrino physics using the far-forward high-energy neutrino beam produced in collisions at ATLAS. This emerging LHC neutrino physics program requires reliable estimates of the LHCâ€™s forward neutrino fluxes and their uncertainties. Here, we provide a new fast-neutrino flux simulation, implemented as a RIVET module, to address this issue. 

### Paper

Our main publication [Far-Forward Neutrino Fluxes and Simulation at the LHC](https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXX)
provides an overview over this simulation and presents its results. We recommend reading it first before jumping into the code.
